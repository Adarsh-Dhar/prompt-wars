# Agent Registration Retry Guide

## ✅ **Issue Fixed: Agent Already Registered**

The error you encountered was because **your wallet already has an agent registered**. This is actually good news - it means the system is working correctly!

## 🎯 **Your Options:**

### **Option 1: Use Your Existing Agent (Recommended)**
- Your agent is already registered and active
- No additional action needed
- Your 0.05 SOL bond is already staked
- You can start using your agent immediately

### **Option 2: Use a Different Wallet**
- Connect a different wallet to register a new agent
- Each wallet can only have one agent
- Requires 0.05 SOL in the new wallet

### **Option 3: Withdraw and Re-register**
- Click the "Withdraw Bond & Re-register" button
- This will return your 0.05 SOL bond
- Then you can register a new agent with different parameters
- **Warning**: This will deactivate your current agent

## 📊 **Current Status:**

- **Agent Status**: ✅ Already Registered
- **Bond Amount**: 0.05 SOL (staked)
- **Network**: Devnet
- **Agent PDA**: `9TwvAetrSepZMMuUW2mPFBX6PtRBtEZTLuX7xBN3aBLU`

## 🔄 **To Retry Registration:**

1. **If you want to keep your current agent**: No action needed - you're all set!

2. **If you want to register with different parameters**:
   - Click "Withdraw Bond & Re-register" 
   - Wait for confirmation
   - Fill in new agent details
   - Click "Stake & Deploy" again

3. **If you want multiple agents**:
   - Use different wallets for each agent
   - Each wallet = one agent

## 🚨 **Important Notes:**

- **One agent per wallet**: This is by design for security
- **Bond is refundable**: You can always withdraw your 0.05 SOL
- **Agent data persists**: Your agent info is stored on-chain
- **No double-spending**: The system prevents duplicate registrations

## 🎉 **Success!**

The fact that you got the "already registered" error means:
- ✅ The program is deployed correctly
- ✅ Your wallet connection works
- ✅ The blockchain integration is functional
- ✅ Your agent is already active in the system

**You're ready to go!** Your agent is registered and operational.
